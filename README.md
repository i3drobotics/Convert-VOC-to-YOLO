# Convert-VOC-to-YOLO
This code converts the VOC XML format to Yolo's labeling format. It uses jpg format but this can be changed in line 13 of "convert_voc_to_yolo.py". 

Instructions:

1) Load images and the VOC XML to the images folder.
2) Open "convert_voc_to_yolo.py" and change the classes in line 9 to those you are using. 

** Use edit_xml.py if there are issues with the xml file not having the correct image size.**
